# Biography

Rie E. Miura is a speciialy appointed assistant professor at the East-Asia ALMA Regional Center(EA-ARC), the ALMA Project in the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. Her research interests include what are the properties of molecular clouds and how massive star cluster form within molecular clouds in relatively nearby galaxies, in order to infer the local star formation process at higher redshift starburst objects. She is a member of "ALMA Centaurus A collaboration", "NRO M33 All Disk Survey of Giant Molecular Clouds (NRO MAGiC)" project. My current job at the EA-ARC is entailed among other task in data reduction, commissioning, as well as the design, testing and improvement of the ALMA Pipeline, and the ALMA Science Archive.
